### Description
In this project we use Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms to identify patterns in sounds of industrial machines such as slider,pump,valve and fan.

***
## Getting Started

### Installation
Before running this code you need to have anaconda installed in your system and jupyter notebook running with basic libraries.

To run this code you have to clone the repository or download it as a zip file and run it. But before that we need to install some libraries to run this code.

- Create virtual environment to run this code. 
    - If you are using anaconda --> `conda create -n <yourenvname> python=x.x anaconda`
    - Activate your virtual environment -->
    `conda activate <yourenvname>`

- The library that we have used to read a sound file is `librosa`. It loads the data from a sound file and also extracts the particular features using which we can predict a model for the machines. All these libraries are written in reuirements.txt file.
To install all these libraries do the folling steps:

    1. cd to the directory where `requirements.txt` is located
    2. run the command in your shell: 
        ```javascript
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ``` 
***
### Repo Architecture


#### requirements.txt 

- Gives all the required libraries to run thiss code.

***

### Usage
- Once you have all the libraries successfully installed you can open and run each model to get the output
    ```javascript
    jupyter notebook
    ```
